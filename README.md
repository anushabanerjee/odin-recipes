# Odin Recipes
A simple HTML webpage (feat. my favorite food) made as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## My Learnings

1. HTML is the skeleton of a website.
2. HTML requires clear structuring for effective presentation.
3. Structuring content is key; itâ€™s the difference between a good read and an *unreadable* mess.
4. Commit messages should be short, clear, and written in the imperative.
5. Additional learning: Making a website on recipes makes me hungry.
