    <!-- Steps Start -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, beat the egg,
          soy sauce and sugar. Add the chicken to the bowl and toss until evenly
          coated. Let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce,
          sugar, vinegar, orange juice, broth, cornstarch, sesame oil, and
          pepper flakes together. Set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Coat the chicken:</strong>In a medium bowl, whisk the
          cornstarch, flour, and baking soda. Sprinkle over the chicken/marinade
          mixture and toss until each piece of meat separates and has a dry,
          clumpy coating.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Fry the chicken:</strong>Line a plate with a few layers of
          paper towels and set next to the stove. In a large nonstick skillet
          over medium-high heat, heat about ¼ inch of oil to 350°F. You'll know
          it's ready when you drop a piece of chicken in, and it sizzles
          vigorously. Working in three batches so as not to crowd the pan,
          shallow-fry a third of the coated chicken until golden brown and
          crispy, 4 to 5 minutes, turning once midway through cooking and
          adjusting the heat as needed. Transfer the chicken to the paper
          towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Finish the dish:</strong>Carefully drain the oil from the pan
          and wipe clean with a paper towel. Add about 1 tablespoon of oil. Over
          medium heat, add the ginger, garlic, and scallion whites. Cook,
          stirring constantly, for about 30 seconds until fragrant; do not
          brown. Add the sauce, bring it to a boil, and let it cook until
          thickened and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the crispy chicken, tossing
          until the sauce fully coats it, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the dark
          green scallions and serve over rice.
        </p>

    </ol>
