  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Tempura is one of the most popular and well-known Japanese dishes around
    the world! Besides using vegetables, the Japanese often use seafood as a
    main ingredient. Among seafood, shrimp is definitely the most popular! You
    probably see shrimp tempura at your local Japanese restaurants. In Japan,
    we call it <i>ebi no tempura</i> (海老の天ぷら) or <i>ebiten</i> (えび天).
    Ebi means shrimp and ten comes from tempura.

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Before You Start:</strong> Gather all the ingredients. I strongly encourage you to weigh your flour in
        metric using a kitchen scale. Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient
        measurements to metric. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff
        your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop
        more flour than you need. </p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <h3>To Make the Dipping Sauce:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients for the tempura dipping sauce.</li>
        <li>Combine ¾ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin, and 2 tsp sugar in a small
          saucepan and bring it to a boil. </li>
          <li>Lower the heat and let it simmer until the sugar is completely dissolved.
          Remove from the heat and set aside. Tip: For a quick dashi, use ¾ cup (180 ml) water + 1 tsp dashi powder.
        </li>

      </ol>

    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>To Prepare the Shrimp:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Peel 10 prawns, leaving on the tail and last shell segment (closest to the tail). Straighten the shrimp so
          it looks gorgeous; learn how in my post on how to prepare shrimp. Pat dry with paper towels to completely
          remove any surface moisture. Any excess moisture will keep the tempura from getting crispy and make it soggy.</li>
          
          <li>Tip: We typically use black tiger prawns to make shrimp tempura at home. Tempura specialty restaurants in
          Japan use the more-expensive Japanese tiger prawns.</li>

      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>To Prepare the Oil:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a wok or a medium-sized pot, add 3 cups neutral oil or enough for 1½ inches (3 cm) of oil in the pot.
          Heat the oil to 340–350ºF (170–180ºC) and check the temperature using a thermometer. To check with wooden
          chopsticks, dip them in the oil; when small bubbles form around the tips, the oil is ready. Be sure to
          maintain the oil temperature at all times. </li>
          <li>Tip: For enhanced aroma and taste, I like to add 1 part sesame oil
          for every 10 parts neutral oil.</li>

      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>To Make the Batter:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>While the oil is heating up, prepare the tempura batter. We‘ll use a 1-to-1 ratio (by volume) of flour to
          egg + water. First, gather the batter ingredients.</li>
        <li>Next, sift 1 cup all-purpose flour (plain flour) into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) and 200 ml iced water to a measuring cup or bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg mixture vigorously and discard the foam on the surface.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the egg mixture into the flour. Mix the batter, but do not overmix; it‘s okay to leave some
          lumps. Keep the batter cold at all times. I store mine in the refrigerator until ready to use. Make the batter
          right before deep-frying to avoid activating the wheat gluten in the flour.</li>
        <li>Dust the shrimp lightly with potato starch or cornstarch. The starch acts as a glue that helps the batter
          adhere to the shrimp.</li>
        <li>Now, dip the shrimp in the batter and add them to the hot oil. Add a few shrimp pieces to the batter bowl.
          Pick up one piece by the tail, dip in the batter, let the excess drip off for 1–2 seconds, and very gently
          place in the hot oil. Continue to dip and add one piece at a time. Do not crowd the pot. Tip: When you
          deep-fry, do not overcrowd the pot because the oil temperature will drop quickly and your food will absorb too
          much oil. Your ingredients should take up no more than about half of the oil surface area at any one time.
        </li>
        <li>Deep-fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Don‘t overcook the shrimp; otherwise, the texture will be
          tough and dry. Transfer the shrimp to a wire rack or a plate lined with a paper towel to drain the excess oil.
          Between batches, skim and discard the crumbs in the oil, which will burn and turn the oil darker if left in
          the pot.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>To Serve:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Peel and grate 2 inches daikon radish and gently squeeze out some of the liquid.</li>
        <li>Prepare 3–4 Tbsp warm tentsuyu in each individual dipping bowl with 1 Tbsp grated daikon per serving on the
          side. Add the grated daikon to the dipping sauce, then dip the Shrimp Tempura in the sauce to enjoy.</li>
      </ol>
